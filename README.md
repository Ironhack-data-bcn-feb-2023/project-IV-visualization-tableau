# project-VI-visualization-tableau

In this project you will use your knowledge of visualization tools to make a report or dashboard that tells the story for you.

The idea is that you will use data to capture ideas in the form of graphs and visualizations so that you can show the client (teacher and teaching assistant) the needs of their business/the answer to the questions they asked/the research about the curiosities they have.


## TO DO's

1. Find the data: Use what you already have or find a simple dataset from kaggle or some data source....  Don't get stuck finding data, we are also interested in knowing which pizzas are eaten the most in NY üòâüòâüçï

2. Explore the data a little: Although the idea is to have a clean data set, make sure the data has a good structure and if you must relate several tables, make sure they are well related.

3. Define one or two simple hypotheses: it should not be complicated to ask yourself questions, sometimes the simplest ones show more information.

4. Go crazy with the charts: Play with the application and make a lot of charts, think if they make sense and delete the ones that do not.

5. Prepare a storytelling: Let your dashboard tell a story, help us understand the needs and/or curiosities from the beginning.

6. (Optional) Prepare a powerpoint to defend your point. üí™

## How to deliver the project

1. Create a new repository in your github profile.

2. Add two folders: project and data (images if necessary).

3. Upload your dashboard (tableau or powerBI file) and your data set to the corresponding folder.

4. Create an Issue in this repository and comment in it, the link to your repository.

5. Create a `README.md` file on repo root with project documentation. Make sure to include as much useful information as possible. Someone that finds the README.md should be able to fully get a gist of the project without browsing your files.
